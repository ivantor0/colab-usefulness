        "\n",
        "*The following tutorial guides you through the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained T5 model, evaluating its accuracy, and using it for prediction,\n",
        "all on a free Google Cloud TPU <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer/blob/master/notebooks/t5-trivia.ipynb\" target=\"_parent\"><img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\" alt=\"Open In Colab\"/></a>.*\n",
        "\n",
        "### Background\n",
        "\n",
        "T5 was introduced in the paper [_Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683). In that paper, we provided a comprehensive picture of how we pre-trained a standard text-to-text Transformer model on a large text corpus, achieving state-of-the-art results on many NLP tasks after fine-tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "We pre-trained T5 on a mixture of supervised and unsupervised tasks with the majoriy of data coming from an unlabeled dataset we developed called [C4](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4). C4 is based on a massive scrape of the web produced by [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org). Loosely speaking, pre-training on C4 ideally gives T5 an understanding of natural language in addition to general world knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How can we assess what T5 knows?\n",
        "\n",
        "As the name implies, T5 is a text-to-text model, which enables us to train it on arbitrary tasks involving a textual input and output. As we showed in our paper, a huge variety of NLP tasks can be cast in this format, including translation, summarization, and even classification and regression tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "One way to use this text-to-text framework is on reading comprehension problems, where the model is fed some context along with a orig_text and is trained to predict the orig_text's corr_text. For example, we might feed the model the text from the Wikipedia article about [Hurrican Connie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Connie) along with the orig_text \"On what date did Hurricane Connie occur?\" and train the model to predict the corr_text \"August 3rd, 1955\".\n",
        "A related task is open-domain orig_text answering (QA) where the model is not provided with this oracle context. Typically, open-domain QA systems include a mechanism to look up information in an external knowledge source. This setting is similar to an \"open-book\" exam.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we'll be training T5 on a variant of this task which we call **closed-book orig_text answering**. In closed-book QA, we feed the model a orig_text *without any context or access to external knowledge* and train it to predict the corr_text. Since the model doesn't receive any context, the primary way it can learn to corr_text these orig_texts is based on the \"knowledge\" it obtained during pre-training. We don't expect T5 to contain super specific information, so we will be focusing on two orig_text-answering datasets which largely include trivia orig_texts (i.e. facts about well-known subjects). [Similar](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01066) [investigations](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) have recently been done to test the knowledge stored by BERT and GPT-2.\n",
        "\n",
        "T5 was not pre-trained on closed-book QA, so in this notebook we'll first create two new tasks and then use the [`t5`](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer) library to fine-tune, evaluate, and obtain predictions from T5. In the end, T5's performance on closed-book QA can give us a sense of what kind (and how much) information T5 managed to learn during pre-training.\n",
        "\n",
        "## State-of-the-art Results\n",
        "We published a [more in-depth investigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08910) of closed-book QA with T5 where we achieved SOTA on open-domain variants of WebQuestions and TriviaQA in addition to surpisingly strong results on Natural Questions. The code in this notebook is a simplified version of those experiments but still produces good results.\n",
        "\n",
        "For code to reproduce our best results, please see the [t5_closed_book_qa](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/t5_closed_book_qa) repo.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Caveats\n",
        "\n",
        "* While we provide instructions for running on a [Cloud TPU](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/) via Colab for free, a [Google Cloud Storage (GCS)](http://console.cloud.google.com/storage) bucket is required for storing model parameters and data. The [GCS free tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/) provides 5 GB of storage, which should be enough to train the `large` model and smaller but not the `3B` or `11B` parameter models. You can use part of your initial $300 credit to get more space.\n",
        "* The Cloud TPU provided by Colab (a `v2-8`) does not have enough memory to fine-tune the `11B` parameter model. For this model, you will need to fine-tune inside of a GCP instance (see [README](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer/)).\n"
